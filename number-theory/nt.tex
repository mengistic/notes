The motivation of this comes from the fact that solving 
equations like $x^n+y^n=z^n$ is rather hard. For example, 
case $n=2$, the equation becomes
\[z^2=x^2+y^2=(x+\i y)(x-\i y)\]
so we need a language to say that $(x+\i y)$ is a divisor 
of $z^2$, I guess. And here comes the 

\begin{definition}
  For any square-free (not a perfect square) integer $d$,
  we define
  \[\Z[\sqrt{d}]:=\{x+y\sqrt{d}~:~ x,y\in\Q\}.\]
\end{definition}
In $\Z[\sqrt d]$, we define the usual addition and multiplication
as follow: for $a+b\sqrt d,~x+y\sqrt d\in\Z[\sqrt d]$, then
\[ (a+b\sqrt d)+(x+y\sqrt d)=(a+x)+(b+y)\sqrt d \]
and
\[ (a+b\sqrt d)(x+y\sqrt d)=(ax+byd)+(ay+bx)\sqrt d \]
