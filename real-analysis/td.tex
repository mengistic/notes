\begin{example}
  Let $A$ be nonempty and bounded below.
  Prove that $\inf(A)$ exists.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}[Proof 1]
  Define $\L(A)$ to be the set of all lower bounds of $A$.
	Notice that $\L(A)$ is bounded above. Of course, let
  fix $a\in A$, therefore $b\leq a$ for all $b\in\L(A)$.
  This implies that $a$ is an upper bound of $\L(A)$, and thus
  bounded above. By AoC, it has supremum. Let's denote it's
  supremum by $m$. Thus
  \[m\leq a,\quad\forall a\in A.\]
  If $m_0$ arbitrary lower bound of $A$, then $m_0\in\L(A)$, then
  we must have $m_0\leq \sup(\L(A))=m$. This implies that
  $m=\sup(\L(A))$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$.
  Moreover, $\inf(A)=\sup(\L(A))$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof 2]
  Let $B:=\set{-a}{a\in A}$. Let $\ell$ be arbitrary lower bound
  of $A$. Then $\ell\leq a\iff -\ell\geq -a$ for all $a\in A$.
  This implies that $B$ is bounded above. By AoC, let
  $-s:=\sup B$. We conclude that
  \[
    \begin{cases}
    	-s \geq -a,\quad \forall a\in A\\
      \text{if }\forall a\in A,~ -s_0\geq -a\implies -s_0\geq s.
    \end{cases}
  \]
  Muliply both eqations by $-1$, we obtain that $s$ is the greatest
  lower bound of $A$. Moreover $\sup(-A)=-\inf(A)$.
\end{proof}
