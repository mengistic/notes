\section{Properties of Real Numbers}
For now, let me just assume that the set $\N,\Z$ and $\Q$ 
are already exist. Just note that they're an 
\emph{``Order Field''}. The thing is, there must be some 
number system that is quite \emph{larger} than $\Q$, because
for example, there is no $q\in\Q$ such that $q^2=2$.

To extend from $\Q$, we're going to make up a new number 
system (kinda cheat a little bit, dun you think?) denoted 
by $\R$, which has the addition operation
$(+)$ and multiplication $(\cdot)$ such that for all $a,b\in\R$
\[a+b\in\R\quad\text{and}\quad ab:=a\cdot b\in\R.\]
Since we extended from $\Q$, this new set $\R$ is going to inherit all
the properties from $\Q$ listed below

\begin{enumerate}[label={\bfseries[A\arabic*]}]
  \item for any $a,b\in\R$, then $a+b=b+a$ and $ab=ba$.
  \item for any $a,b,c\in\R$, then $a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$ and 
    $a(bc)=(ab)c$
  \item there is a number (\emph{indentity}) $\theta\in\R$ 
    and $\gamma\in\R$ such that 
    $a+\theta=a\gamma=a$  for all $a\in\R$.
  \item for any $a\in\R$, 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item there exist an \emph{additive inverse} $\alpha$ 
        such that $a+\alpha=\theta$.
      \item if $a\neq \theta$, there exist a 
        \emph{multiplicative inverse} $\beta$ such that 
        $a\beta=\gamma$.
    \end{itemize}
  \item for any $a,b,c\in\R$, then $a(b+c)=ab+ac$.
\end{enumerate}

Well because $\Q\subset\R$ (subspace), the indentity $\theta$ 
and $\gamma$ are the same of those in $\Q$, which we already
know they're simply the numbers $0,1$. 
Note also that, we must assume that $0\neq 1$.
\begin{theorem}
  For any $a,b,c\in\R$, the following holds
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the \emph{additive} and the \emph{multiplicative} 
      indentity are unique. 
      (later denoted them by $0$ and $1$ resp.)
    \item the addition and multiplicative inverses are
      unique. (later denoted them by $-a$ and $a\inv$ resp.)
    \item if $a+c=b+c\iff a=b$.
    \item $a\cdot 0=0,~-a=(-1)a$ and $-(-a)=a$.
    \item if $ab=0$ then $a=0$ or $b=0$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
