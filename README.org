* My Notes in University
I started this repo in 2021, the year I entered college
to pursue mathematics. Here, I keep all of my notes and
everything that is quite important to me. And I am going
to use this as an opportunity to learn basic git commnds
as well.

Note also that, these are my personal notes, so almost
everthing here are incorrect.
