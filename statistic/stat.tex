\chapter{Propobility}
\section{Prerequisite}
Statistics applied to 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Goverment: IQSS
  \item life
  \item Finance
  \item Gambling: origin of probability, i.e Fermat and Pascal (1650)
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
  These are some definitions.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A \emph{Sample Space} is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
    \item An \emph{Event} is the subset of the sample space.
    \item The probability of event $A$, denoted as 
      $$P(A)=\frac{\text{\#want}}{\text{\#possibility}}$$
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Here, we assume that all outcomes are equally likely, and finite
sample space. What's the probability that there is life in Neptune?

\subsection{Couting}
\begin{theorem}[Multiplication Rule]
  If there is an experiment with $n_1$ possible outcomes, and 
  the second experiment has $n_2$ possible outcomes, and so on.
  Then the overall outcomes are
  \[n_1n_2n_3\dots n_r.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
  The numbers of way to choose $r$ items from the total of 
  $n$ items is
  \[\binom{n}{r}:=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\]
\end{theorem}
